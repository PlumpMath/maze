So lets make some planning on today's work.

* Add to the IRenderer protocol:


** draw-walls
*** graph-renderer
**** DONE redo with special walls placeholder

****

*** DONE canvas-renderer


** Im tinking to add hight-level method to the IRenderer: draw-game


* Implement Processing renderer

* Bring all renderers implementation into dedicated file( namespace )

* Implement editor mode
  So I think that will be at least two modes:
  1) game mode
  2) level editor mode

* DONE Make testing second repl
** DONE inside thins second repl start separated JavaFX window


* Look at some others code (Halloway for ex.)

* oDesk + VirtualBox
